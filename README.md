# Allagash Shipping Optimization

This is the capstone project for ALY6980 (Winter 2025) conducted in collaboration with Allagash Brewery.


## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze and optimize the logistics and supply chain of Allagash Brewery using data-driven methods. Key tools used include:

- **Python** for data processing and modeling (`pandas`, `seaborn`, `geopy`, `meteostat`)
- **Power BI** for visualization and dashboarding
- **Streamlit** for interactive decision support on truck selection and shipment cost estimation

## Key Outcomes
- Identified 8.9% cost reduction through route and truck-type optimization
- Estimated 12% savings by consolidating shipments via a custom cost calculator
- Developed interactive dashboards to monitor cost efficiency and pallet utilization
